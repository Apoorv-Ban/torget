## Release
### v1.0

- Magnet Download - After selecting the desired torrent people can directly add the magnet link to your torrent client.

### Bugs 
- There is one known bug that I am working on is if the torrent name has charecters that are not supported on terminal the script crashes currently i have a temporary solution not to print the full name of torrents but this will be fixed soon.

#### Windows 
- .exe included inside the build folder created using *Setup.py* to directly run the app without having python installed on your system.
- If you have python installed will recommend running using powershell or cmd using `python torget.py`

### Linux
- run the *torget.py* script using the **Bash Shell** using `python torget.py`
- tested on debian linux i.e mint/ubuntu/kali make sure you python installed and a torrent client

### Mac
- Should run easily in mac if python is installed by executing in the terminal *Not Tested*
